### SEEK Android team coding task ###

There are issues with the `Display Job Details on a new screen` commit on the main branch.

Task 1:
Using a production quality lens, review the `Display Job Details on a new screen` commit
as if it were a Pull Request on a separate branch and identify as many issues as you can. 
What are the issues and why? How would you improve it and why?

Task 2:
Refactor the code and create a branch (as if it were a new PR), implementing the solution in a better way.
You can choose to reuse as much or as little of the existing code as you want without any limitations.
For example, you can create a new branch on top of the latest commit on main to fix the issues,
or you can reimplement the solution from scratch by branching off an earlier commit.
Explain your solution and why it's better.

When complete, please zip up your solution (include the .git folder) and send it back to us.
DO NOT share the coding task publicly, or upload it as a public github repository.
